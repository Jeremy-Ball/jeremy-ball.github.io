			<h1> 
				My name is Jeremy Ball. I live in Gainesville, where I have been living for 18 years.
			</h1>
			<p>
				I started school in 2022 for a degree in Network Security but quickly fell in love with programming and web design. Although I have only taken an intro class to programming in Python, 
        I have since taught myself many techniques. 
        I have also started teaching myself JavaScript to broaden my knowledge in programming and to make my website more robust and interesting.
			</p>
			<p>
				While in school I worked as a phlebotomist for HCA Healthcare. The skills I learned working with a diverse set of patients from all walks of life have taught me compassion for others and for myself.
        As a phlebotomist I have spent a lot of time working with medical technologists, nurses, doctors, and patient care techs.
			</p>
			<p>
				IT was never my first passion or why I originally went to school. I was studying ecology and sustainability for a few years before I decided to change my degree to better support my family. 
        I hope to combine my love for nature with my passion for IT and I hope to be able to write secure programs for companies that believe in a sustainable future. 
        My background in science and healthcare gives me a unique insight into the user functionality of programs. I want to write and design programs that meet the needs of real people who rely on them.
