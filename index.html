      <p>My name is Jeremy Ball and I have recently graduated with an A.S. degree in Network Security -  Risk Management at Santa Fe College. 
	I have designed this webpage to showcase the skills that I’ve learned so far. 
	My experience includes website development, SQL database, writing code in Python, JavaScript, and using security and risk management software.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I chose IT:</h3>
      <p>The IT program at Santa Fe College has proven to be very accessible with online courses and as a recipient of the Charles Blount Foundation scholarship the entire A.S. program was paid for. 
	Choosing a degree in IT was a no brainer.
      </p>
      <h3>Why cybersecurity?</h3>
      <p>Security is about more than just keeping networks safe. It’s about giving people the peace of mind that their information is secure and growing that mentality around the world. 
	Computers are no longer just devices we use to help us achieve personal goals. They are entire frameworks that define our health, safety, and economic prosperity. 
	And besides, the outlook for jobs in network security is immense. It involves an understanding of programming, web development, psychology, sociology, and business practices. 
	Any field you name in IT can benefit from an understanding of cybersecurity and I'm attracted to the prospect of having a broad and sensible career that I can go anywhere with.
