      <h3>The body</h3>
      <p>
        The body of this layoutis a Flexbox container and ends at 2000px. It is bordered in red. The items in the container are bordered in black. This way any large device, whether a projector or a TV, will view the body of the website at the same size. setting "margin: 1% auto;" sits the body in the middle of the html document. setting "flex-flow: row wrap" allows me to manipulate the items in a horizontal fashion. "justify conter: space-around;" allows me to evenly space the items apart.

        <h3>The header</h3>
        <p>
          This will be the same code I use across every web page. The red borders are the items of the body and the black borders are the child items inside of them. Using percentages in my width and margins will allow the items to scale with the device width.

      <h3>The Main and Footer</h3>
      <p>
        The main section is made up of a photo and an article. I leave the width of each to about 50% so that the website will always scale at that size no matter what device is used. This is going to make it easy to write media queries as I will not need many of them to keep the formatting nice. The footer will stay the same across all of the other web pages. I use the top margin on 5% to give the bottom of my webpage more space.

      <h3>Website at max size: 2500px</h3>
      <p>
        I created a maximum body size using pixels at 2000px. This stop the website from stretching too much on very large devices like TV's and projectors. As the screen reaches 2000px I will add a media query that locks the body at 95% of the HTML document. The black borders surrounding the container items are all sized at a percentage of the body. SO no matter how big a device gets they will always remain the same relative to the 2000px wide body.

      <h3>Website at max width: 1500px</h3>
      <p>Following responsive web design I will scale my viewing width down until the formatting begins to break. I nab the body width at 95% before it hits 2000px then resize a few margins to keep things tight. Because everything is sized relative to the body I really don't need to do much to keep it all looking good.</p>

      <h3>Website at max width: 800px</h3>
      <p>
        Once again, very little needs to be done to keep everything fitting together. At this size will be devices like small tablets. I only needed to change a few margins. The next media query will be my last one and it will be a "one-size-fits all" for people using their cellphones to visit my website.

      <h3>Website at max width: 500px</h3>
      <p>This is going to be the media query for mobile devices like cell phones. Many people frequently use their cell phones to browse the web and it's imperative that this step is done correctly. It uses a little extra code but for the most part it's straight forward. We're stacking all of the container items by using "flex-flow: column wrap;" then using justify and align on the container to center the items. Because the image in my website is tall, I crapped the face and blended it into a linear-gradient background. This is the trickiest media query to get right and is why mobile-first design is becoming so popular.
