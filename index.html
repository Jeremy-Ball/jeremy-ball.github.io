          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>My name is Jeremy Ball and I’m currently studying for an A.S. degree in Network Security -  Risk Management at Santa Fe College. I have designed this webpage to showcase the skills that I’ve learned so far taking classes. My experience includes website development, SQL database searches, and writing code in Python.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I chose IT:</h3>
          <p>The IT program at Santa Fe College has proven to be very accessible with online courses and as a recipient of the Charles Blount Foundation scholarship the entire A.S. program was paid for. Choosing a degree in IT was a no brainer.
          </p>
          <h3>Why cybersecurity?</h3>
          <p>Security is about more than just keeping networks safe. It’s about giving people the peace of mind that their information is secure and growing that mentality around the world. Computers are no longer just devices we use to help us achieve personal goals. They are entire frameworks that define our health, safety, and economic prosperity. And besides, the outlook for jobs in network security is immense. According to the bureau of labor statistics:
          <blockquote>“Employment of information security analysts is projected to grow 35 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations."
          </blockquote>
          <p>That’s good enough for me.
